# Convertor from JPK to SDF

A short script to convert from .jpk files to .sdf files.

## Usage
In MATLAB, just run the main.m file.

The +jpk folder is the code repo for the .jpk file reading. The function is a copy (with few modification) of this MATLAB exchange [repo](https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68760-open_jpk/).

The +sdf folder is the code repo for the .sdf file writing.
